# SAL.tmlanguage

A language definition for Nyquist SAL along with indentation defaults. Requires Sublime Text 3. Also adds a build system and SAL documentation. This package can be installed by adding this repository to [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).

# Features

  * Building a SAL file runs the file in a fresh Nyquist terminal instance.
  
  * Builds can be cancelled by running the build again.
  
  * Pressing `F1` on a built-in function brings up the function parameters in a panel, and full documentation is brought up in a web browser.
